## Podman

Podman is an alterative runtime to docker & can now operate as a replacement for docker desktop on Windows & Mac.  This will explore the Docker Desktop to podman transition.

### Mac

#### Install with [brew](/articles/brew)

```bash
brew install podman
```

#### Basic commands

Initialize VM containers will run inside.  This is a one time setup command.
```bash
podman machine init
```

To start and stop the VM container environment, run the below commands.
```bash
podman machine start
podman machine stop
```

Stop container VM
```bash
podman machine stop
```

#### Run Hello World

```bash
podman run --rm hello-world
```
```

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

#### Transitioning from Docker CLI & Docker Compose

The first convenience step is to alias the docker cli command to Podman.  Podman is cli compatable with docker, so this should work in most cases to allow your existing scripts & tools to use Podman rather than docker. 

If you want to set an alias in your terminal session, run and/or put this alias into your . profile file such as .bashrc or .zshrc.
```bash
alias docker=podman
```

I have found this generally works for a terminal session, but for use with scripts which may not run using those profile files, it can be useful to set an symbolic link to the podman executable.  This will make the docker command available to even scripts that don't source your profile files.

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/podman /usr/local/bin/docker
```



Next, if you use docker compose regularly, follow these steps to use podman with Docker Compose.  

Install [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose), an alterative to docker compose implemented with rootless Podman.
```bash
pip3 install podman-compose
```

Similar to the docker cli aliases, you can create aliases for docker-compose with the alias command or by symbolic link
```bash
alias docker-compose=podman-compose
```

```bash
ln -s $(which podman-compose) /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### Issues / Looking Forward

I saw a few issues while testing podman / podman-compose to replace docker & docker-compose.

+ Mouting Shared folders does not have first class support (https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8016)
+ Docker Compose multiple app logging (currently returns Error: logs does not support multiple containers when run remotely)


I think these issues are generally minor / being actively resolved.  Using Podman is certainly more effort that using Docker Desktop, but is a viable alterative.
