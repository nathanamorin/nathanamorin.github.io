description: Using Kind configuration to create more complex k8s infra
---

To make the process of building more complex Kind infra, Kind provides configuration files which can
be passed to the kind create CLI.

This example will be walking through creating a dev ready Kind cluster for web app development which
will allow hosting a Frontend/Backend/DB with Ingress resources.


## Setting up cluster

The below command will setup a 3 node cluster.

```
echo '''
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
- role: worker
- role: worker
''' | kind create cluster --config=-
```

```

You can check the cluster node status by running
```
kubectl get nodes
```
```

kind-control-plane   Ready    master   5m8s    v1.19.1
kind-worker          Ready    <none>   4m38s   v1.19.1
kind-worker2         Ready    <none>   4m38s   v1.19.1
```

Configure an Nginx ingress controller
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
```

```
tic/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
namespace/ingress-nginx created
serviceaccount/ingress-nginx created
configmap/ingress-nginx-controller created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx created
service/ingress-nginx-controller-admission created
service/ingress-nginx-controller created
deployment.apps/ingress-nginx-controller created
validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/ingress-nginx-admission created
serviceaccount/ingress-nginx-admission created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx-admission created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx-admission created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx-admission created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ingress-nginx-admission created
job.batch/ingress-nginx-admission-create created
job.batch/ingress-nginx-admission-patch created
```

Run this command to wait until ingress controller is ready (espeshally important in CI test environments)
```
kubectl wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
```
```
pod/ingress-nginx-controller-55bc59c885-8kcp4 condition met
```


Deploy example app to test ingress deploy.  This deploys two pods & services, with an ingress that directs
traffic between the two services.

```
kubectl apply -f https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/examples/ingress/usage.yaml
```
```
pod/foo-app created
service/foo-service created
pod/bar-app created
service/bar-service created
```

You can view these services by accessing:
+ [http://localhost/bar](http://localhost/bar)
+ [http://localhost/foo](http://localhost/foo)


In order to demonstrate the end to end workflow, this guide will walk through a very simple app deployment.  This app will just return the number of requests recieved.  The container will be built locally & deployed in Kind.  Network ingress will come through the ingress setup previously.

The first step is to create a docker image with the required dependencies.  For simplicity in the demo, I've included the docker file inline in the docker build command below.

```
echo '''
FROM python
RUN pip install flask requests''' | docker build -t k8s_demo:local -f - .
```

To push the docker image to Kind, run ```kind load docker-image k8s_demo:local```.  This makes the docker image available in the Kind k8s cluster.

Then, run the following command to deploy a container with the config to Kind:

```
echo '''
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: demo-api
data:
  run.py: |
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    num_requests = 0
    @app.route("/api")
    def count():
        global num_requests
        num_requests += 1
        return(str(num_requests))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
---
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
  labels:
    app: demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: demo
    image: k8s_demo:local
    command: ["python"]
    args: [ "/app/run.py" ]
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config
      mountPath: /app
  volumes:
    - name: config
      configMap:
        name: demo-api
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  selector:
    app: demo
  ports:
  - port: 5000
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Exact
        backend:
          service:
            name: demo
            port:
              number: 5000

''' | kubectl apply -f -
```

```
configmap/demo-api created
pod/demo created
service/demo created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/demo created
```

You can view the resources created by running ```kubectl describe <either ingress,pod,or configmap>```.  

Once the pod starts, you can view the app by opening: [http://localhost/api](http://localhost/api) which returns the request count.

Finally, to cleanup & delete the cluster, run ```kind delete cluster```
