## Flycut
Flycut is a fantastic clipboard manager for Mac, plus it's OpenSource!  It has a clean focused UI that allows natural
interaction with your clipboard history.  This is always one of the first apps I install & is indispensable to my
development workflow, expanding the number of text copies you can interact with at a time.


Installation is simple with [Brew](./brew): ```brew install --cask flycut```.

Flycut toolbar shows history & allows search.

Run ```CMD + Shift + v``` to activate the copy context view & arrow keys to navigate forward & back in clipboard history.
