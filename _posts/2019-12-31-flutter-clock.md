## Flutter Clock Challenge

This is a simple text clock face inspired by the idea of a physical clock of stacked cylinders representing each time metric.  The lower cylinders represent finer metrics which, as they make complete revolutions, increment the next higher cylinder.

The app source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathanamorin/flutter_clock).  I tested it using Andorid, but it should be able to run on IOS as well.  Below, I have linked a web version of the app (currently using flutter's **beta** web builder)
